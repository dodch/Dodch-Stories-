            The air grew colder, and the last orange leaf from the front yard tree drifted to the ground. Soft clouds blanketed the sky as the sun’s fading rays made their way to brighten someone else’s life. The distant hum of birds began to fade, replaced by the gentle whispers of the wind slipping through windows and doors. Inside warm homes, families gathered, their laughter and conversations rising in harmony with the crackling fire, which shared its comforting warmth.

In that quiet town lived a young man named Winter, named so because he was born on a snowy night. But his arrival came with tragedy—his mother passed away while bringing him into the world. From that moment, Winter’s father became his entire world. Despite the loss, their bond was unbreakable, a relationship rooted in love, sacrifice, and understanding.

Winter’s father devoted himself fully to raising his son, even losing his first job because he prioritized caring for him. To make ends meet, he began gathering firewood and selling it to nearby families and farmers. Though the work paid little, the joy on Winter’s face when his father prepared his favorite meal made every effort worthwhile.

One day, during a walk through town, Winter stopped in front of a shop window, his eyes lighting up at the sight of a beautiful suit displayed inside.

“Dad, Dad, look at this!” he exclaimed, pulling his father’s hand.

His father leaned down, smiling. “Oh, that looks wonderful.”

“Do you think it would look good on me?”

“Of course, son. You’re always beautiful, no matter what you wear.”

“I wish I could have it,” Winter said, his voice softening. “But it’s okay. I know you can’t afford it.”

His father knelt to meet his son’s eyes and said, “I promise you, my handsome boy, I’ll buy it for you as soon as I can save enough money.”

“Really, Daddy? Thank you! I love you! You’re the best!”

“I love you too, son,” his father said, pulling him into a warm embrace.

Winter grew up to be a kind, understanding boy, never once neglecting the love and sacrifices of his father. And his father never forgot the promise he made that day. He worked tirelessly, gathering every spare coin to buy the suit his son admired so much. Finally, after weeks of effort, he saved enough. He bought the suit with joy and carefully wrapped it, eager to surprise Winter.

That same day, while bringing firewood home to keep his son warm, a fierce windstorm swept through the town. As he made his way back, clutching the precious gift in one hand, a large tree, uprooted by the wind, came crashing down. It struck him before he could react, leaving him unconscious and alone in the cold.

An hour later, villagers passing by found him. But it was too late. His kind, selfless soul had already left this world. In his frozen hand, he still held the wrapped gift for his son.

The news struck Winter like a dagger to the heart.

“I’m so sorry for your loss,” said Mr. Smith, their kind neighbor. “I know how much you loved your father, but this is life, son. It’s cruel, and it takes the best of us too soon.”

“You’re lying!” Winter cried, tears streaming down his face. “My father would never leave me! Never!”

“I wish I were lying,” Mr. Smith said softly. “But I’m not. I lost my own daughter six years ago to a drunk driver. I know the pain you feel.”

Reaching into his bag, Mr. Smith pulled out a package and handed it to Winter. “We found this with your father. I believe it’s meant for you.”

Winter hesitated, his trembling hands unwrapping the gift. When he saw what was inside, his voice cracked. “It’s… it’s the suit I wanted. He really bought it for me.”

Tears filled his eyes as he clutched the suit tightly. In that moment, Winter realized the depth of his father’s love—a love so pure it had endured even in his final breath.

The gift had lost its meaning without the warmth of his father’s soul, and Winter couldn’t bring himself to wear it. It served as a painful reminder of the past, hidden away in a box, buried in a dark corner.

Later, Winter was adopted by the Hope Organization, a group dedicated to helping orphans by providing them with care and education for a brighter future. Though he was surrounded by kind people who looked after him, he never felt the same deep connection he once shared with his father. Over time, he withdrew into himself, becoming an introvert. The fear of losing someone again after forming an attachment consumed him, driving him to prefer solitude. Winter spent his days alone, gazing at the night sky while calm music played, letting his thoughts drift until drowsiness overtook him.

This became his way of life—until the eve of his 17th birthday.

In the classroom that day, Winter sat in his usual spot at the back corner. On the opposite side, a new student kept glancing at him, as if contemplating something. At first, Winter paid little attention, but when their eyes briefly met, the boy quickly turned away, pretending nothing had happened. Winter shrugged it off and returned to focusing on the lesson.

Later that evening, during a break, Winter found himself under a tree, enjoying the quiet. To his surprise, the same student from earlier approached and sat nearby. With a soft smile, he broke the silence.

“Hello, quiet boy.”

Winter blinked, caught off guard, and murmured, “Uh… hey.”

“Why do you look so confused?”

“I’m sorry,” Winter replied shyly. “I’m not used to talking to strangers.”

“That’s okay,” the boy said warmly. “We’re not strangers for long. I’m Pal. I’m new in town. What about you?”

“I’m… Winter.”

“Winter,” Pal repeated with a curious smile. “That’s an interesting name—just like you. I couldn’t help but notice how distant you are, always sitting alone. I hope you don’t mind me saying so, but… why?”

Winter hesitated but eventually spoke, his voice tinged with vulnerability. “It’s just… no one’s ever noticed me before. It’s strange to have someone care. I’ve felt so alone since… since my dad passed away seven years ago. He wasn’t just my father; he was my best friend.”

Pal’s expression softened. “I’m so sorry, Winter. That must’ve been incredibly hard. But you know… it’s not the end. You don’t have to carry this weight alone anymore. I—I can be your new best friend.”

Winter looked up, his eyes searching Pal’s. “Really? But… why? I’m just some weird, quiet guy who keeps to himself.”

“You’re not weird,” Pal said firmly. “You’re hurt. You’ve been through so much, but you haven’t let yourself start over. I see the part of you that’s still waiting to come alive. I think you’re someone special. Let’s fix what the past has broken. Let’s try new things, have fun, and find joy again. What do you say?”

For the first time in years, Winter felt a glimmer of hope. A small smile tugged at his lips as he replied, “You know what? You’re right. Screw this sad world. I want to live!”

“That’s what I want to hear!” Pal beamed. “Welcome to my life, brother.”

From that day on, Winter and Pal became inseparable. They shared countless adventures, discovering mutual hobbies like swimming and writing music together. Over the years, their bond grew so strong that people often mistook them for biological brothers. They completed each other, always there in times of need. Even when they fought, they would quickly reconcile, their friendship unshaken. Together, they healed old wounds and created a future full of light and laughter. As if drawn by an unbreakable bond. Through their struggles, they discovered that problems and mistakes were not meant to divide but to strengthen their connection, forging an even deeper understanding with every challenge. They came to realize that perfection isn’t what makes us human—our imperfections are what make us unique. By embracing each other’s flaws, we create a love so pure and authentic that it revealed the true meaning of love: a celebration of imperfection.

As the years went by, Winter turned twenty. One day, as he strolled through the university hallways, earbuds in, listening to Sodus, a moment unfolded that felt like it belonged to another world. Ahead of him, a girl was arranging books on her drawer. The sunlight poured through the window, illuminating her golden-brown eyes and radiant blonde hair. Her features were unclear at first, but when their eyes met, the sun reflected perfectly, and the moment collided with the song’s 1:49 mark, making it feel magical, almost otherworldly. Winter’s heart raced in a way he had never felt before, as though time itself had paused just for them. She noticed him, offering a soft, gentle smile before turning and walking away.

For the first time, Winter felt something stir within him—an emotion he couldn’t quite grasp. That evening, he told Pal about it, his voice brimming with uncharacteristic excitement.

“There was this girl today,” Winter began. “Our eyes met, and she… she looked like an angel. For a moment, I forgot everything—where I was, who I was. It was like the world faded, and she was the only light. But then she walked away, and I felt… something strange.”

Pal grinned knowingly, giving his friend a playful nudge. “Looks like someone’s fallen in love.”

“What? No way!” Winter protested, his cheeks flushing. “It was just a moment. I don’t even know her. Love isn’t something that happens so quickly. It takes time, understanding, and acceptance. I think I just… liked her. That’s all.”

“Sure, bro,” Pal teased, his grin widening. “But listen, life’s about new experiences. Don’t overthink it. Just try talking to her. What’s the worst that could happen?”

Winter nodded, his friend’s advice replaying in his mind as he lay in bed later that night, Sodus on repeat. His thoughts kept circling back to the girl, replaying that fleeting moment over and over.

A few days later, Winter saw her again, sitting under his favorite tree, engrossed in a book titled Golden Hour. Gathering his courage, he walked over and sat beside her. For a moment, he hesitated, but then he finally spoke:

“Hey, that’s an interesting book you’re reading.”

She looked up, her soft smile making the world feel quiet again. “Yeah, it really is…”

Winter couldn’t help but add, “It’s called Golden Hour, just like your hair and eyes in the sunlight. It’s like you and the book are perfectly matched.”

Her cheeks flushed, and she replied, smiling shyly, “Oh… thank you. I really love this book.”

Their eyes met, and the same feeling from before returned—time slowing as their hearts beat faster, synchronized.

Breaking the silence, she spoke, her voice a little nervous yet sweet. “I’m sorry, I didn’t introduce myself. I’m Snow. What about you?”

Winter’s eyes widened in surprise. “Snow? Really? That’s incredible. My name is Winter.”

She laughed softly, her voice like a melody. “Winter and Snow? I guess destiny wanted us to meet.”

“Seems like it,” Winter replied, a smile playing on his lips.

From that day on, Winter felt that meeting Snow wasn’t mere coincidence—it was fate. Her presence brought a warmth he’d never known, filling the voids in his heart. Her gentle smile, calm voice, and radiant demeanor drew him closer, but what made him fall in love completely was her mind. She was brilliant, thoughtful, and had a deep understanding of life. They often had long, meaningful conversations, never tiring of each other’s company.

Each evening, Winter shared his growing feelings with Pal, recounting every detail of his time with Snow. Pal was genuinely happy for his friend, proud of the way Winter balanced his relationships. Despite his newfound love, Winter never neglected his bond with Pal. They continued their adventures, spent their days together, and shared laughs as always.

Snow admired this loyalty, knowing she’d never feel replaced or pushed aside. She appreciated the unbreakable brotherly bond Winter shared with Pal. To her, it showed the depth of his love and his unwavering loyalty to those who mattered.

Winter’s relationships, though few, were profoundly meaningful. Pal reminded him of his late father—a brother he never expected but cherished deeply. And Snow? Snow was the warmth of a mother’s embrace he had longed for but never known. Together, they completed the family Winter had always yearned for, filling his life with love, faithfulness, and joy.

One quiet evening, Snow and Winter sat under the night sky, the stars twinkling like scattered diamonds above them. Snow rested her head gently on Winter’s left shoulder, their breaths forming faint clouds in the crisp air. They spoke softly, their voices blending with the serenity of the moment.

Winter broke the silence. “Do you know that my hands have always been cold? Ever since I was born during a snowy storm—that’s why my father named me Winter.”

Snow lifted her head slightly, her voice tender as she replied, “And I was called Snow because, when I was born, my heart wasn’t beating, and my blood wasn’t flowing. I was pale, lifeless… They thought I was gone. But then, a miracle happened. My soul came late into this world, and I started breathing. Life filled my veins, and I was given a second chance.”

Winter looked at her, amazed. “Wow… You really are unique, Snow. A beautiful gift from God. I think we were meant to be together. It’s strange—when you’re far away, I feel cold. But when you’re here, I feel warm.”

She smiled softly, her eyes glowing in the starlight. “And I will always be your warmth—warming your heart, your body, and your soul. You know… me and you, we’re like a candle.”

Winter tilted his head, curious. “A candle? How so?”

She smiled, her voice soft but sure. “Let’s say you’re the string, and I’m the fire. Together, we make light, illuminating the world around us. And when we burn, we burn together, all the way down, until the candle ends—until the end of our life.”

Winter’s eyes glistened with emotion as he added, “I also noticed something—you said life, not lives. I knew you meant it, because after we met, our souls collided. We became one. Your life is mine, and my life is yours.”

Snow leaned closer, her voice soft and full of emotion. “That’s why I love you, Winter. You always notice the small things—the things that matter the most.”

This love was so simple—nothing extraordinary or beyond imagination. It wasn’t a fantasy or a fairy tale about a princess and a prince in some magical realm. No, this was real, the kind of love you could live every day if you dared. Yet somehow, people treat it like an impossibility, something to be written about but never truly lived.

But you’re here, reading this, because you believe otherwise. You want to learn how to love. You want to understand that even from nothing, you can build something—a relationship, a family, a warmth that defies the cold.

This isn’t a story. It’s a reflection of who you are—or perhaps who you long to be. So don’t forget to be special in your own way.

If you’ve made it this far, it means you love this world I’ve crafted for you. And more importantly, it means there’s still a heart inside you, one that yearns to live and to carry on its own love story. You’re here because you know you’re deserving of love. You can create it, shape it, and make it even more beautiful—just like you.

The university trip was the perfect excuse for Winter to break free from routine and explore the world a little more. He’d managed to grab three tickets: one for himself and two for his other halves, Snow and Pal. It was his surprise for them—a chance to bring together his best friend, Pal, and the person who made his heart glow, Snow.

When the day finally came, Winter could barely contain his excitement. There they were, the three of them, standing side by side for the first time. Winter was beaming, but the moment Snow saw Pal, her expression shifted into shock.

“Pal?!” she exclaimed, wide-eyed.

Pal looked equally surprised. “Snow?!”

Winter, caught completely off guard, glanced between them. “Wait, you two know each other?”

Snow’s voice rose as she answered, “Of course I do! We studied together in college for three years. He was my friend, but then he moved—”

Pal interrupted her quickly, his tone nervous. “Oh, yeah! That was a long time ago. Well, it’s… nice to see you again.”

Snow hesitated for a moment, her eyes clouded with something unreadable. “Nice to see you too,” she said, her voice carefully measured.

Pal laughed softly, brushing the tension aside. “I guess we don’t need any introductions, then. But I never expected you two to know each other. That’s… amazing.”

“Yes, amazing,” Snow echoed with a small, uneasy laugh.

Winter smiled, oblivious to the undercurrent between them. “Well, this is perfect! My two favorite people finally meeting!”

The awkwardness seemed to fade as they got on the bus and began their journey. Conversation flowed easily enough between them as they rode through winding roads, anticipation building with each passing mile.

Their first destination was breathtaking: a massive mountain with endless sceneries of natural beauty. The crisp air filled their lungs as they stepped off the bus, gazing out at the sprawling landscapes. Excitement buzzed between them as they prepared to explore.

But beneath the surface of the laughter and camaraderie, questions lingered. Snow and Pal exchanged glances now and then, as if the past they shared was a shadow they couldn’t quite escape. Winter, meanwhile, remained blissfully unaware, his heart full at the thought of spending this day with the people he cherished most.
  

They spent a wonderful time together, cherishing every moment of their holiday trip. They had rented a small house perched on a snowy cliff, its cozy interior a perfect retreat from the cold. The trio bonded over cooking experiments, attempting new recipes and baking cakes. Their first attempt ended in disaster—Snow accidentally burned the cake, filling the kitchen with smoke. But instead of frustration, the room filled with laughter, the kind that leaves your sides aching and your heart warm.

Their second try, however, was a triumph. The cake turned out perfect—soft, sweet, and a little lopsided, but delicious. They celebrated their success by taking silly poses for pictures, making exaggerated chef hats out of towels and pretending to present the cake like professionals. The photos became instant treasures, souvenirs of their first “cake night” together.

Two days later, they traveled to their next destination: the Winter Gate Festival. It was a marvel of human creativity—a small city sculpted entirely out of ice. Buildings, statues, and arches glittered under the light, each carving a masterpiece. In the heart of the festival lay a massive ice park filled with games, food stalls, and laughter.

Pal stole the show that night. His uncanny skill at the festival games left Winter and Snow speechless. From knocking down cans to ring tosses, Pal won prize after prize, earning himself the playful title of “Champion of the Night.” The trio couldn’t stop laughing as Pal tried to juggle the pile of stuffed animals and trinkets he’d accumulated.

Later, they decided to try the festival’s most popular attraction: a high-speed train ride that twisted and turned through a series of icy loops. Snow hesitated, her face pale as she stared at the towering ride.

“I’m not sure about this…” she murmured.

“Come on, Snow! It’s going to be fun,” Winter encouraged, his excitement contagious.

“You’ll love it,” Pal added with a reassuring smile. “We’ll be right next to you.”

Reluctantly, Snow agreed. They took their seats, the ride starting with a jolt as it climbed its first hill. The wind whipped through their hair as the train gained speed, thrilling screams echoing through the night. But as the train approached its first upside-down loop, disaster struck.

Pal’s seatbelt had not been properly secured. As the train flipped, he lost his grip and fell violently to the ground below.

The world seemed to stop. Winter and Snow screamed, their voices tearing through the air. The ride halted abruptly, passengers disoriented as panic set in. Winter and Snow rushed to Pal, their hearts racing with fear. He lay unconscious, blood pooling beneath his head.

Moments later, the ambulance arrived, the medics working swiftly to stabilize Pal before rushing him to the hospital. Winter and Snow followed, their hands trembling, their faces pale.

In the hospital hallway, time dragged unbearably. Winter sat in a chair, his head in his hands, tears streaming down his face.

“It’s going to be alright,” Snow said, her voice trembling, her eyes red. She placed a hand on his shoulder, trying to comfort him even as her own heart broke. “Don’t worry, it’s going to be alright.”

Winter looked up, his voice fragile and raw from crying. “You don’t understand. I can’t lose him. I can’t handle this moment again. Why does this always happen to me? Why can’t I just love and be happy with the people I care about?”

Snow knelt beside him, her own tears spilling over. “I do understand, Winter. I feel the same pain you do. I’m sorry I can’t comfort you the way I want to… I feel just as helpless.”

Winter’s voice cracked as he continued. “He’s my only friend, Snow. He’s everything I have. He taught me how to be myself, how to love. He’s always had my back, encouraged me to do the things I was too scared to do. He’s the reason I even had the courage to talk to you for the first time. He brought us together. I love you both equally, and I pray I never lose either of you. I’d rather it be me than watch either of you hurt like this.”

Snow’s lips trembled, but she couldn’t form any words. Her tears fell silently as she held onto Winter’s hand, both of them consumed by the same overwhelming fear and love for the person lying beyond the hospital doors.

They waited, their hearts heavy with unease, as the seconds dragged on and minutes turned into hours. Finally, the door creaked open, and the doctor emerged. Winter darted toward him, his face pale, his breaths uneven.

The doctor looked at Winter and Snow, his expression a mix of exhaustion and pity. “I have both good news and bad news,” he began.

Winter’s voice rose, trembling with desperation. “Just tell me, doctor. Is my brother okay? Please… tell me he’s okay. I’m begging you!”

The doctor raised his hand gently, his tone measured but tinged with gravity. “Calm down, sir. We’ve done everything we could to stop the bleeding from his head. Your friend is stable…”

Winter let out a shaky sigh of relief, his knees nearly giving out beneath him. “Thank God… thank God!”

“…but,” the doctor continued, his face clouded with sorrow, “he’s fallen into a coma.”

Winter froze, his breath hitching. “What?! No… no, this can’t be!”

The doctor nodded solemnly. “The blow to his head was severe. He’s lucky to be alive. But the damage to his brain is significant. We’re hopeful he’ll wake up soon, but…” The doctor hesitated, his voice softening. “When he does, there’s a strong chance he may suffer memory loss. And we can’t predict how severe it will be.”

The words hit Winter like a storm, each syllable sinking into his chest. His eyes glistened, but he managed to whisper, “At least… at least he’s still alive. His heart is still beating…”

Snow stood silently by his side, her hands clasped tightly. She glanced at Winter, then back at the doctor, but said nothing. The air between them grew heavy, the weight of the news pulling them into silence.

Finally, Snow touched Winter’s arm gently. “You need to step outside. Breathe a little,” she urged softly.

But Winter shook his head. “I’m staying.”

Seeing his resolve, Snow reluctantly left, leaving Winter alone in the sterile, echoing halls. He slumped onto a cold wooden bench, his head in his hands. The night dragged on endlessly, each moment colder than the last. His fingers turned numb, his breath visible in the freezing air. At some point, exhaustion overtook him, and he drifted into a restless sleep.

When he woke the next morning, stiff and shivering, he rose and walked unsteadily to Pal’s room. The sight before him stopped him in his tracks. Pal lay still, pale against the stark white of the hospital bed, surrounded by machines that beeped steadily. The once vibrant soul he knew was now a shadow of itself.

Winter’s knees buckled as he approached. He sank into the chair beside the bed, his head bowing, and his hands trembling. Tears streamed freely down his cheeks, his voice breaking as he spoke.

“I’m sorry, bro… I’m so sorry,” he whispered, his words barely audible. “I feel so helpless. There’s nothing worse than watching someone you love in pain and not being able to do a damn thing about it. I wish—” He paused, his voice cracking. “I wish it was me instead of you.”

He wiped his face roughly, struggling to steady himself. “I know… I haven’t been around much since I met Snow. You know how much I love her. But that doesn’t mean I love you any less. Don’t ever think that, okay?”

Winter swallowed hard, his voice faltering. “Me and Snow… we’re like a candle. She’s the fire, and I’m the string. Together, we light up the world. But I forgot something really important.” He choked back a sob, his hands clutching Pal’s. “You’re the oxygen, bro. Without you, the flame wouldn’t burn. You’re the reason I even learned to love. You lit up my life in ways I never thanked you for.”

He leaned closer, his forehead brushing against Pal’s cold hand. “You mean as much to me as Snow does… maybe even more. Please, wake up, bro. Please…”

Winter stood abruptly, unable to bear the stillness any longer. He looked at Pal for a long moment, his tears tracing quiet paths down his face, before whispering, “I’ll come back. I promise.”

With that, he turned and left, his shoulders heavy with the weight of his words, his heart clinging to the fragile hope that Pal would hear them.

The next day, it was foggy, cloudy, and very cold. The light was soft, and the sun wasn’t shining. It was the kind of weather that many people loved, but at the same time, it carried an aura of calmness and loneliness. In weather like this, people often sought the warmth of their loved ones, gathering in homes full of love and comfort. Winter was heading home when he stumbled upon a small kitten on the sidewalk. She was pure white but seemed frightened and frozen. Her innocent eyes looked up at him, and Winter couldn’t bear the sight of her. He couldn’t leave her to suffer in the cold. Gently, he scooped her up and tucked her into the inside pocket of his jacket, his voice soft and playful. “You’re a part of my life now,” he said with a smile. The kitten mewed faintly, as if thanking him.

He took her home, fed her, and gave her some warm milk. She drank eagerly, her hunger evident, and Winter couldn’t help but smile at the little creature in his care. As he sat there, watching her, a knock came at the door. Winter opened it to find Snow standing there, her eyes soft with concern. She took a step forward, placing her hand on his right cheek. “I missed you, baby,” she said, her voice full of tenderness. “Are you okay? Do you feel any better? Is Pal okay?”

Without answering, Winter pulled her into a tight embrace. She hugged him back, even tighter, resting her head on his shoulder. Their hearts seemed to beat in perfect unison, and for a moment, the world outside faded away. The kitten, sensing the warmth of their love, ran between their feet, as though wanting to be part of the embrace. Snow noticed her and gasped, surprised by the little white bundle. “Oh my god! Did you get a cat? She’s so cute!”

Winter’s smile deepened as he looked at Snow. “Yeah, I found her nearly frozen on the street. I couldn’t leave her behind.”

Snow looked at him with admiration, her voice soft and sincere. “Oh, baby, you made the best decision. I know your soft heart beats with mercy and kindness.”

They sat together on the couch, the cat nestled between them, sharing the cozy spot as snow fell softly outside. Snow leaned back with Winter beside her, caramel popcorn in hand — Winter’s favorite snack. The TV played quietly in the background, but their conversation soon took precedence.

Snow turned to him, her voice soft but deliberate.
“You know, Winter, there’s something I’ve been meaning to talk to you about…”

Winter, caught off guard, adjusted his position to face her.
“What is it, Snow?” he asked, his tone laced with curiosity.

“It’s about Pal,” she began, hesitating for a moment. “He wasn’t just a random classmate when I first met him…”

Winter’s eyebrows furrowed, confusion flickering across his face.
“What? What do you mean?”

Snow took a deep breath. “There’s a lot I haven’t told you yet.”

Winter leaned in, his voice gentle but pressing.
“You’re confusing me, Snow. What are you trying to say?”

“Okay,” she said, steeling herself. “Just listen, please.”

Winter nodded, his expression now serious.

“When I was in school, Pal transferred as the new kid in town. At first, there was this tension between us — I couldn’t stand him, honestly. He was this arrogant, rich kid who acted like he owned the place. We clashed constantly, inside and outside the classroom.”

Winter couldn’t help but chuckle, cutting her off.
“Wait, what? Pal? Rude and rich? Are you joking? He’s the most down-to-earth guy I know!”

Snow raised an eyebrow and shot him a pointed look.
“Can you let me finish?” she said sharply.

“Okay, okay,” Winter said, raising his hands in mock surrender. “Sorry, it’s just hard to picture. Go on.”

Snow sighed and continued, her tone softening.
“Back then, my dad was very sick. He couldn’t work anymore, and we were struggling to afford his medication. I felt so helpless as his only child, so I started working as a waitress to help. It was overwhelming — juggling work and school left me exhausted, and it showed. One day, I was sitting alone in class, holding back tears, when Pal walked in.

He saw me and, of course, made some sarcastic comment like, ‘What’s wrong, Blondie? You look all sad and stuff.’”

Winter chuckled. “That sounds like Pal.”

Snow shot him a look but smiled faintly before continuing.
“I told him to mind his own business, and he walked away. I didn’t think much of it, but then I ran into him again at work. He came in with his friends, and I felt so embarrassed. I thought he’d make fun of me for being a waitress, but instead, he just smiled and said, ‘Hey, Snow. You working here?’

I shrugged it off and took his order. When he was leaving, though, he came up to me and apologized for being mean. He said, ‘If you ever need anything, just let me know.’

I brushed it off because I didn’t want anyone’s pity. But things got worse. My dad’s condition declined, and I had to work extra hours. School got mad at me for all my absences, and they threatened to kick me out. It felt like everything was falling apart.

One day, I was sitting in the school garden, crying, when I felt a hand on my shoulder. I looked up, and there he was. Pal. He asked me what was wrong, and this time, I told him everything. I had no choice.

He listened quietly and then said, ‘Snow, I’m here for you. Don’t worry — I’ve got you.’

I was stunned. I asked him what he meant, and he said he would pay for my dad’s medications and help me with whatever I needed so I could focus on school.

I couldn’t believe it, i told him that I thought he hated me and then I asked him why he was doing this, and he just smiled and said, ‘Hate you? I never hated you, Snow. I thought you were cool, and I guess I didn’t know how to show it. I can be a jerk sometimes, but I’m not that bad.’”

Snow paused, her voice trembling slightly as she added,
“From that day on, he changed my life. He helped my dad recover and supported me like no one else ever had. My parents adored him — he was like a son to my dad and a brother to me. He came over all the time to check on us, have dinner, and make sure we were okay.”

Winter was silent, his throat tight with emotion. When he finally spoke, his voice was thick.
“Why didn’t you tell me this earlier, Snow? Pal… he was my brother. My other half. I’ve missed him so much…”

Tears welled in his eyes as he looked at Snow, and for a moment, they sat together in quiet remembrance of the man who had left such a profound mark on both their lives.

It had been two weeks since the accident, and Pal was still lying there—fragile, unmoving, and suspended between life and death. Winter visited him every single day, sitting by his bedside with hope tethered tightly to his heart. Each visit, he willed Pal to wake up, to return to him, to fill the aching silence that had consumed his life. Without Pal, the world felt colder, heavier, and utterly empty.

Snow, seeing Winter’s pain, stayed by his side through it all, doing everything she could to comfort him. One day, she suggested something that caught him off guard: “Why don’t we visit the elderly who have no one? They’re lonely too, Winter. Maybe… maybe it could help both them and us.”

Though hesitant at first, Winter eventually embraced the idea. For the first time in weeks, he felt a flicker of warmth—like he belonged somewhere again. Together, he and Snow began visiting elderly households, bringing light to people who had long been surrounded by shadows. Winter listened to their stories, shared laughter, and even joined them for tea. He started feeling like he was part of a family again.

One woman, Grandma Jessica, adored Winter like he was her own grandson. Her joy was contagious, and when her 80th birthday came, she insisted Winter and Snow join her celebration. The small room buzzed with warmth as everyone gathered. Winter held the cake steady as the room erupted in song, with Jessica’s eyes sparkling like stars.

When it was time for her to blow out her candle, she paused. She stepped back, a strange look crossing her face—half hesitant, half wistful. Her voice, laced with nostalgia, filled the room.

“When I was 30,” she began, her voice soft but steady, “I thought about turning 50, and I told myself that 50 was a long way off. I didn’t have to think about it. But then I blinked… and I’m 80!” She laughed, but there was a hint of sadness behind it.

A man in the crowd called out, “Time flies!”

Jessica nodded, her voice starting to tremble as she continued. “But the truth is, I never made it to my dream job. I never got to see Paris in the spring. I never got to live in the house my husband and I used to dream about.”

The same man gently interrupted, “Sweetheart, your candle—”

Jessica shook her head and kept going, her eyes glistening with tears. “No, just let me finish. I kept putting things off. Every year, I’d say, ‘We’ll do it next year.’ And then the next year came, and I’d say it again. And again. And now… now there’s no more ‘next year’ for me.”

A fragile silence hung in the air, broken only when Snow gently placed her hand over Jessica’s trembling wrist. She didn’t say a word, but her touch was enough. Winter’s eyes met Snow’s, and in that moment, they both remembered the metaphor they had once shared: life is like a candle. The flame flickers brightly but burns faster than you expect, and before you know it, the wax is gone, and the light fades.

Jessica finally blew out the candle, her breath shaky but resolute. The room erupted into applause, but Winter couldn’t shake the lump in his throat. He thought of Pal. He thought of the moments he had taken for granted. And he thought of the fleeting nature of it all.

As the party carried on, Winter and Snow exchanged a quiet look. They understood now—life wasn’t something to be postponed. It wasn’t something to wait for. It was something to live, fully and fiercely, while the flame still burned.

It is Saturday morning. The weather is warm, and the sun is rising, painting everything in its path a soft pink before transforming into golden beams filtering through the tree branches. The sky grows clearer, adorned with scattered white clouds. Birds are awakening, their chirps mingling with the nostalgic song of a morning dove.

The sunlight finally reaches the window, slipping through the curtains. Tiny specks of dust shimmer in its glow, rising as if ascending through a golden gate to the heavens. It feels like a motivational scene, urging the start of a new day, inviting someone to rise from bed.

The warm glow softly lands on Winter’s closed eyes, caressing his skin with a gentle touch. He stirs and finally wakes, feeling refreshed and unburdened, as if the world had gifted him a moment of unspoken hope. He couldn’t quite put the feeling into words.

Rising from bed, Winter glances into the mirror and feels alive. The day carries the weightless beauty of a nostalgic dream, where everything looks and sounds effortlessly perfect.

Winter’s cat, Boggo, jumped onto him, purring and meowing insistently for food. Winter smiled softly, his eyes warm as he greeted his furry companion. “Good morning, my little boy. Hungry? Come, let’s get you some food.”

He gently picked Boggo up and carried him to the kitchen, placing him down to fill his bowl. As Boggo happily ate, Winter prepared his own breakfast and enjoyed the peaceful start to the day.

Later, he decided to go for a walk in the nearby park. The weather was beautiful, and he took his time jogging along the paths, feeling the cool breeze against his skin. After a good run and some light exercises, he felt tired and found a bench overlooking a serene lake. Ducks floated lazily on the water, their quiet quacks adding to the tranquil atmosphere.

As Winter watched the scene, lost in thought, two hands suddenly covered his eyes from behind. “Guess who!” an excited voice chimed playfully.

Winter grinned immediately. “Snow? Is that you?”

“Who else would it be?” she said, laughing.

He turned to see her smiling face and felt a surge of joy. “Oh my god, good morning, darling! I missed you so much. I didn’t expect to see you here. Come, sit next to me.”

Snow slid onto the bench beside him, her eyes sparkling. “I saw you from a distance and thought I’d surprise you.” She gave him a warm smile. “It’s a beautiful day, isn’t it, Winter?”

“Yeah,” he replied, gazing at her. “I don’t know what’s going on, but today feels…majestic. Everything is perfect. And you…you even look more beautiful than ever.”

Her cheeks turned rosy as she laughed softly. “Oh, baby, thank you. But do you know what’s even more beautiful?”

He tilted his head curiously. “What is it, Snow? Surprise me.”

“You’re going to be more than surprised.” She grinned, her excitement barely contained.

“Come on, don’t tease me! What happened?” Winter urged, his curiosity growing.

Snow’s eyes lit up as she said, “Your friend…he’s finally awake!”

Winter’s eyes widened in disbelief. “What? Are you serious?”

“One hundred percent serious! After one whole year! Isn’t it unbelievable?”

He sat frozen for a moment, his eyes welling with tears of joy. “Oh my god…thank God! This day just keeps getting better and better. Is this a dream?”

Snow leaned closer, her voice gentle and reassuring. “It’s not a dream, darling. Everything is completely real.”

He quickly grabbed her hand. “Let’s go. We should see him right now.”

They took an Uber to the hospital, trying to contain their excitement. The car was silent, the air thick with anticipation, until Snow broke it with a hesitant voice.

“Before we reach the hospital, there’s something you need to know…” she said softly, her voice barely above a whisper.

“What’s wrong, babe?” Winter asked, his brows furrowed with concern.

Snow sighed, her eyes looking out the window as she tried to find the right words. “Pal is completely fine and healthy, but…”

“But what, Snow? You’re scaring me.”

She turned to him, her voice carrying the weight of the news. “Do you remember what the doctor said the last time? About his memory?”

Winter nodded slowly, his chest tightening.

“It actually happened,” she said, her voice cracking slightly. “Pal lost his memory after the accident. He forgot a lot of things. He didn’t even recognize me—like, not at all. He looked so confused, and I felt so sorry for him.” She paused, trying to stay composed. “But at least he’s awake now. Who would’ve thought this day would actually come?”

Winter looked down, the pain evident in his eyes, but he said nothing.

When they reached the hospital, Winter couldn’t wait another second. He bolted up the stairs, his heart racing, and pushed open the door to Pal’s room.

There he was, sitting upright on the hospital bed, reading a book. Pal looked up, startled, and set the book aside. Before he could say a word, Winter rushed toward him and wrapped him in a tight hug, holding him as though he might disappear again.

“I’ve missed you, bro,” Winter said, his voice trembling.

Pal leaned back, his expression puzzled. “I’m sorry, but…do I know you?”

Winter felt a sharp pang of sadness, like a knife twisting in his chest. But he masked it with a soft smile. “I guess not,” he said quietly, “but we’ll get to know each other. I’m Winter.”

Behind them, Snow stood in the doorway, watching the heartbreaking scene unfold. Her eyes filled with tears, and one single drop fell silently down her cheek.

Winter left Pal in the hospital to rest. The doctors needed more time to ensure he had fully recovered. Stepping outside, he took Snow’s hand, and they walked together in silence. The air was crisp, carrying the scent of damp earth. Snow finally broke the stillness.

“I heard everything… I don’t know what to say, but being forgotten by someone so close must be painful.”

Winter’s grip on her hand tightened. “Yes… but it’s okay. I’ve been through a lot. I’ve learned to go with the flow, handle the changes, and adapt. I’m sure everything will be alright. Even if we forget each other, I believe our hearts will always remember.”

She glanced at him, a soft, knowing smile on her lips. “True… I think even if people lose their memories, they’ll fall in love with the same person all over again.”

“But only if it’s true love,” he added.

She nodded. “Yeah. Only true love is unforgettable. But if it ends… it leaves a scar.”

Winter turned to her. “What makes you say that, Snow? Have you been hurt before? Have you lost someone?”

Her gaze dropped slightly. “Kind of. I’m full of scars… but I wouldn’t call them losses. They’re lessons.”

He stopped walking. Gently, he tucked a strand of her hair behind her ear. “Why would anyone ever want to hurt you? You’re beautiful, kind, and—”

She cut him off. “Don’t. Even if I were an angel, people would still find a way to hurt me. I bet they’d even cut off my wings.”

Winter let out a small laugh. “Snow, what are you saying?”

She sighed. “It’s just… no matter how good or beautiful you are, people will still be cruel.”

He met her eyes with a steady gaze. “Maybe. But that’s not your burden to carry. Don’t dim your light to satisfy people—it’ll never be enough for them. The ones who truly see you will love you for who you are, imperfections and all. I’m here, Snow. I see you.”

For a moment, she just stared at him, as if memorizing every detail of his face. Then, without warning, she threw her arms around him, holding him tight, resting her head on his shoulder.

“I wouldn’t survive a single day if you ever hurt me,” she whispered. “That scares me. You make me so attached to you.”

His smile was soft, almost melancholic. “You don’t realize how much I feel the same. And that scares me even more.”

A sudden downpour interrupted them. Heavy rain crashed onto the pavement.

Snow gasped. “Oh my God, Winter! Run, we’re gonna get soaked!”

Laughing, he pulled off his jacket and held it above their heads. They sprinted through the streets, their hair and clothes drenched, their laughter echoing between the buildings.

Final Chapter

The next day, Winter returned to the hospital to visit Pal, but he wasn’t there.

“Sorry, have you seen the guy in Room Five?” he asked a passing doctor.

The doctor glanced at his clipboard before answering. “His condition stabilized, so we allowed him to leave.”

Winter frowned. “But he has memory loss! Why didn’t you call me at least?!”

“I’m sorry, sir. It just… didn’t cross my mind.”

Frustration boiled in Winter’s chest. He didn’t bother responding—he just turned and left, heading straight to Pal’s house.

When he knocked on the door, a woman he had never seen before answered.

“Good morning,” she greeted with a polite smile.

“Morning… Sorry, but who are you?”

She tilted her head. “I think I’m supposed to ask you that question,” she chuckled.

“I’m Winter. I came to see my friend Pal. He was in a coma for a long time, and today he got out.”

Her smile faded into confusion. “Pal? I don’t know anyone by that name.”

Winter’s eyes narrowed. “What do you mean? He lives here. It’s not like I lost my memory too! I’ve been here countless times—I know this place inside out. There’s even a jasmine tree in the backyard if you don’t believe me.”

“I believe you,” she said gently. “But… I bought this house about five weeks ago.”

Winter stiffened. “Bought the house? What are you talking about? He wasn’t even here to sell it.”

“There must be some misunderstanding, dear,” she replied, stepping back slightly. “I bought this house from Mr. Smith—the legal owner. I still have the paperwork if you’d like to see.”

Winter took a step back. His mind spun. Mr. Smith? The name barely registered.

He looked at the documents she held out, but the words blurred together.

This didn’t make sense.

It was like the world was playing a cruel trick on him.

Why do weird things keep happening to me? Can’t I live in peace for once?

As he left, his feet carried him to the only person who might have answers—Snow.

—

That evening, he told her everything.

She listened silently, but something in her expression felt… off. Like she already knew.

Then, she sighed.

“Oh my God, Winter… I don’t know how to tell you this.”

“What?”

“Pal’s past is more complicated than you think. I don’t think you really knew him.”

Winter tensed. “That’s not true! He’s my best friend! Of course, I know him!”

She hesitated. “Not really. He had a long story behind him… one he never told you. Smith is his father.”

Winter froze. “What?! But I thought his father was—”

“Dead?” she interrupted.

His mouth went dry. “Yeah… He told me his father got an emergency call from work one day and never came back. For ten years, he had no idea what happened. When his family reported him missing, the police couldn’t find any records of his name or where he worked. It was like he never existed.”

“That’s not the full story,” she said softly.

Winter swallowed. “Then tell me.”

Snow took a deep breath. “Pal’s mother was murdered.”

His heart stopped.

“The police suspected Mr. Smith, but they never had enough evidence. Pal always believed his father was innocent.”

Winter shook his head. “No… No way. That doesn’t make sense. Pal would’ve told me.”

“He was protecting you.”

Winter looked up.

“He saw himself in you,” she continued. “You both didn’t have parents. You had no siblings, but you became brothers. He didn’t want to burden you with his pain—he wanted to be your support.”

Winter clenched his jaw, but he felt his eyes burning.

“He never changed with you, Winter. No matter what he was going through, he stayed by your side. He was a real one.”

Silence filled the room.

Then, he whispered, “But… Mr. Smith is back. That woman saw him when he sold her the house. Do you think Pal is with him?”

“I don’t know,” she murmured.

Winter studied her face.

She wasn’t surprised.

“…Why don’t you seem shocked?”

“I—” She hesitated.

“You what?”

“Nothing,” she said quickly, standing up. “I need to go see a friend. I’ll be back later tonight.”

Winter watched her leave.

Something wasn’t right.

—

That night, he sat on the couch, the TV playing in the background. His cat curled up on his lap, purring softly.

But Winter was somewhere else.

Lost in his thoughts.

Lost in everything that had been taken from him.

Was he cursed? Was he destined to lose everyone he loved?

Maybe.

Maybe this world wasn’t meant for people like him.

Maybe pure hearts didn’t belong in a place this cruel.

Maybe love couldn’t survive in an ugly world.

Maybe… the good ones were meant to be elsewhere.

But not here.

—

Snow never came back.

Neither did Pal.

Winter searched everywhere.

Nothing.

They had vanished.

He spiraled. His mind unraveled. Until loneliness became his only companion—the one thing that would never leave him.

And so, he decided to leave instead.

—

11 PM. The late train.

The station was empty. The air was thick with fog. The coldest night of the year—bitter, biting, yet Winter felt nothing.

He was numb.

He sat on the platform’s bench, staring at the tracks, humming a familiar melody.

Then, softly, he began to sing.

“Without you, I feel broke… without you, I’ve got no hand to hold. Without you, I feel torn, like a sail in the storm. Without you…”

A voice rose from behind the fog.

“I’m just a sad song.”

Winter’s breath hitched.

He turned.

THE END.
