    <p>Have you ever asked yourself what the villain’s life was like?

No — you didn’t.
Your eyes were too busy admiring the hero.
Your heart followed their journey.
And me? I was just the shadow they needed to shine.

But what if I told you my side?

Would you pause?
Would you listen?
Would you feel sorry for me?

No. I don’t want your sympathy.
That’s easy — shallow.
But maybe… you could try empathy.
Just once.

You judged me.
Not for what I did —
But for what you think I am.
For what the world did to me —
Reflected back in everything I became.

I was used.
Drained.
Left hollow by the ones I gave my soul to.

Yes — I loved.
Yes — I had a heart.
I still do.
Even monsters bleed on the inside.

But when a heart is too buried to find,
You pretend it’s not there.
You call it cold.
You call it dead.

That makes it easier, doesn’t it?

You reduce people
To broken pictures,
To crooked roles in your clean little stories —
So you never have to face your own cruelty.

You crowned a hero.
You created a villain.
And you never once wondered if you got it backwards.</p>
    <p>lurketh secrets darker than the night.</p>
        <p>Beware, for in the forgotten corners of this cursed realm,</p><p> doth dwell entities of eldritch horror,</p><p> their eerie whispers echoing through the corridors like the lamentations of souls long departed.</p>
